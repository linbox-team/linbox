     * @fixme This should just be a different LiftingContainer!
     *
     * The algorithm solves Ax = b over the integers.
     * It is based on Chen/Storjohann RNS-based p-adic lifting.
     * Based on https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~astorjoh/p92-chen.pdf
     * A BLAS Based C Library for Exact Linear Algebra on Integer Matrices (ISSAC 2009)
     * But it has been slightly modified in order to use BLAS3 multiplication within the main loop.
     *
     *  RNS Dixon algorithm goes this way:
     *      (i)     Use (p1, ..., pl) primes with an arbitrary l.
     *      (ii)    Algorithm goes:
     *                  for i = 1 .. l:
     *                  |   Bi = A^{-1} mod pi                      < Pre-computing
     *                  [r1|...|rl] = [b|...|b]
     *                  [y1|...|yl] = [0|...|0]
     *                  for j = 1 .. k:
     *                  |   for i = 1 .. l:
     *                  |   |   ci = Bi ri mod pi                   < Matrix-vector in Z/pZ
     *                  |   |   yi = (yi * pi) + ci                 < Done over ZZ
     *                  |   |   (Qi, Ri) = such that r = pi Qi + Ri with |Ri| < pi
     *                  |   V = [R1|...|Rl] - A [c1|...|cl]         < Matrix-matrix in ZZ
     *                  |   for i = 1 .. l:
     *                  |   |   ri = Qi + (Vi / pi)
     *              @note The computation of V can be done in a RNS system such that each RNS base-prime
     *              is bigger than each (p1, ..., pl). This way, [R1|...|Rl] and [c1|...|cl] are zero-cost
     *              to get in the RNS system.
     *      (iii)   y = CRT_Reconstruct(y1, ..., yl)
     *      (iv)    x = Rational_Reconstruct(y)
     *
     * One can configure how many primes are used with `Method::DixonRNS.primeBaseLength`.
     * According to the paper, a value of lp = 2 (ln(n) + log2(||A||)) or without the factor 2
     * can be used, but it depends on the problem, really.
