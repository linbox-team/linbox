	  <h2>Maple-LinBox Package</h2>

	  <p>Version 0.3</p>

	  <h3>What is it</h3>

	  <p>
	    This is an interface between the LinBox library of
	    functions and utilities for the Maple computer algebra
	    system.  It allows you to call LinBox functions from a
	    Maple session.  It is currently under development by Rich
	    Seagraves at the University of Delaware.  Any ideas or
	    suggestions are more than welcome.  The package is made up
	    of a small library that wraps LinBox functions, and a
	    Maple module called LinBox that contains all procedures
	    and external calling definitions.  A new version of the
	    interface is underway that does such things as providing
	    external storage of LinBox BlackBox and Vector types, as
	    well as access to other LinBox functions.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Requirements</h3>

	  <p>
	    The interface requires the following packges:
	  </p>

	  <ol>
	    <li>Maple v6.0 or greater</li>
	    <li>LinBox</li>
	    <li>GMP v3.2 or greater (for LinBox)</li>
	    <li>unix make utility</li>
	  </ol>

	  <p>
	    It is recommended you have the following
	  </p>

	  <ol>
	    <li>Maple v7.0 or later</li>
	    <li>g++ 3.0 or later (compiler on which this library was tested).</li>
	    <li>GNU make utility (gmake).</li>
	  </ol>

	  <h3>Availability</h3>

	  <p>
	    The current release of this library can be obtained via
	    HTTP from <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~seagrave/MapleLB.tgz">http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~seagrave/MapleLB.tgz</a>.
	    The package can also be obtained from the LinBox team's
	    CVS server at linbox.pc.cis.udel.edu.  Contact <a
	    href="mailto:root@linbox.pc.cis.udel.edu">root@linbox.pc.cis.udel.edu</a>
	    for access to that server.  The bleeding edge version of
	    the package is availabe from that server under the unit
	    name MapleLB
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    At the moment, the package has been tested under SUN
	    Solaris and theoretically will only work on Unix variant
	    systems (sorry Window's users, my knowledge of .dll files
	    is lacking).  As more people download the package and test
	    it out, I can make it more robust.  If a Windows user
	    feels up to figuring out a window's build system, I would
	    be more than happy to include it.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Installation</h3>

	  <p>
	    The interface is pretty simple at this point, 1 include
	    file and a source file.  Thus the build system is little
	    more than a <tt>makefile</tt> that requires some editing.
	    You will need to know where Maple, GMP, and LinBox are
	    installed on your system.  Edit the <tt>makefile</tt> to
	    reflect these locations.  Once that's done, just type
	  </p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p><tt>gmake install</tt></p>
	  </blockquote>

	  <p>
	    and the <tt>makefile</tt> should do the rest.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Usage</h3>

	  <p>
	    The <tt>makefile</tt> will generate a script file
	    containing the proper definition of the interface for your
	    system.  It is called linbox.mpl.  In Maple, type
	    '<tt>read "/directory/you/installed/to/linbox.mpl";</tt>'
	    at the prompt to get the module.  The package also
	    contains worksheet called <tt>demonstration.mws</tt> that
	    demonstrates the usage of the interface.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Wow, this interface is horrible.  What's wrong with you? :-)</h3>

	  <p>
	    Hey, give me a break, this is a demonstration.  I've got
	    something better in the works.  If you think it's that
	    bad, why not send me some constructive criticism or help.
	    I always love help.
	  </p>
