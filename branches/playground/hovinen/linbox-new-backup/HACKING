In this file are instructions for developers and those wishing to
contribute to Linbox. It is intended both for the uninitiated and for
the reference of existing developers.

I. Compilation and installation

If you are installing from a tarred distribution, please see the file
INSTALL for basic instructions on how to install Linbox. If you are
installing from CVS, please see the instructions in section (III)
below.

II. Basic layout

Linbox is a template library, so installation requires very little
actual compilation. Nearly all of the library is in header
files. Directories in the source distribution are as follows, relative
to the tree's root:

doc/      - Documentation (see below)
examples/ - Simple examples to help new users get started with the
		library
macros/   - Files to assist the build system
src/      - All library source (i.e. header files) goes here
	algorithms/ - Specific algorithms, such as Wiedemann and Lanczos
	blackbox/   - Black box (i.e. matrix) objects
	element/    - Objects representing field elements
	field/      - Objects representing fields (e.g. rationals,
			integers modulo p, etc.)
	iterator/   - Iterators allowing one to browse the entries in a
			vector
	random/     - Random number generators
	vector/     - Vector implementations
		sparse/ - Sparse vectors
		dense/  - Dense vectors
	util/	    - Utility routines that don't belong anywhere else
test/     - Tests for library performance and correctness
util/     - Scripts and other miscellaneous items, mostly for making
		library maintenance easier 

N.B. Though the doc/ directory contains some top-level and tutorial
documentation, reference documentation is stored in parallel with the
source code, under the src/ tree.

III. CVS

Linbox is stored in a CVS repository at the University of Delaware. To
access the latest bleeding edge copy of Linbox from this source, you
will need a working copy of CVS and all of the GNU development tools
(e.g. autoconf, automake, GNU make, and so on). To access CVS:

1. Set your CVSROOT environment variable (on Bourne shell):

export CVSROOT=:pserver:<username>@linbox.pc.cis.udel.edu:/home/cvs

(and on the C shell):

setenv CVSROOT :pserver:<username>@linbox.pc.cis.udel.edu:/home/cvs

2. Log in to CVS; you only ever need to do this once for any given
Unix shell account:

cvs login

3. Check out the linbox module

cvs -z3 co linbox

The -z3 option compresses the data in transit, making the operation
faster for remote users.

4. Switch to the newly-created linbox directory and run the script
autogen.sh, optionally specifying the installation prefix:

cd linbox
./autogen.sh [--prefix=<prefix>]

5. Install the library:

make install

When you want to update your tree with the contents of the main CVS
repository, issue the following command from the linbox/ directory:

cvs -z3 up -dP

The -z3 option is as before and the -dP option tells CVS to update the
directory structure as well as the files. Note that the order of items
in that command *is* important.

You should receive some information on what files have been
updated. If any files have a "C" before them, this means what you have
conflicts with what is in the repository. In other words, you made
changes while someone else made other changes and CVS does not know
how to reconcile the two. You will need to edit that file manually,
looking for and fixing lines like

<<<<<<<<<<<

===========

>>>>>>>>>>>

that show the sections that could not be reconciled.

If you have made changes and would like to commit them to the global
repository, issue the command

cvs -z3 ci [<filename(s)>]

The optional filename(s) argument specifies what you would like to
commit; the default is to commit everything that has changed in the
current directory and its descendents. When you enter this command, a
text editor will come up prompting you for a log message. *ALWAYS
ENTER A LOG MESSAGE DESCRIBING WHAT YOU HAVE CHANGED*. Failure to do
so may result in your changes being backed out by the
administrator. When you are done entering your message, simply save
and exit the text editor.

If you are not a main Linbox developer but would like to submit some
addition or modification, your code is welcome. Please email a patch
(use 'cvs -z3 diff -u' to form a patch) to us and we will consider
including it.
